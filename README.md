# Transaction Parser

Crude Python scipt to transform multiple bank transaction exports from several formats into a consistent format for review/import.  Mostly written as a simple intro to Python for myself. 

- Processes all files in the `data` directory.
- Outputs csv file containing transactions date, details and amount to the `output` directory. 
- Moves all files in data into a `processed` directory on completion.
